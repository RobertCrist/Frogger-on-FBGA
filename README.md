# Frogger-on-FBGA

This is the final project for EE 271. For it, I created frogger on an FPGA board
using system verilog. The user has full control over the frog and their objective is
to make it accross the display as many times as possible. The score is kept track of 
on the seven segment display and can count up to 999999. When the player collides with
a car, they are prometed with a game over screen and must flip the reset to play again.

For more question about the implementation, please view the schematic attached title
